Steps to run and maintain iTestsDeployer service:

HOW TO RUN:
1. Run VNC on user tgrid to 192.168.9.18:3 (can be done with putty but rather be done with VNC in order to keep tests running while your machine is offline)
2. CD in shell to /export/tgrid/itests-deployer/Cloudify-iTests-Deployer/src/main/groovy 
3. Run the execution command, e.g:

groovy itests_deployer.groovy 5987-165 2.7.0 m5 2 CLOUDIFY_DEPLOYER Cloudify-Regression **/DeploymentsControllerTest.class,**/cli/cloudify/AdminApiControllerTest** **/xen/**,**/*Abstract*,**/cloud/**,**/cli/cloudify/security/**,**/cli/cloudify/cloud/scale/** us-east-1 dummy master dummy 2.7.0-SNAPSHOT 9.7.0-SNAPSHOT 2.7.0-5987-165-SNAPSHOT /tmp/LocalMavenRepos true dummy

The arguments order and meaning is:
0 - tested build number
1 - tested build version
2 - tested build milestone
3 - suite number (how many agent machines will run the tests)
4 - suite name (e.g CLOUDIFY_CLOUDS, can be taken from quickbuild)
5 - suite type (e.g Cloudify-Regression, can be taken from quickbuild)
6 - regex which implies which tests are INCLUDED in the suite seperated by "," (can be taken from quickbuild)
7 - regex which implies which tests are EXCLUDED in the suite seperated by "," (can be taken from quickbuild)
8 - ec2 region (when running cloudify clouds should be us-east-1 because of the machine limit in eu-west)
9 - byon machines (when running byon tests - can be taken from quickbuild) 
10 - branch name - when this argument is "dummy" the branch is automatically trunk, when testing older versions this argument MUST be changed into the correct branch
11 - package name 
12 - s3 cloudify publish folder (e.g 2.7.0-SNAPSHOT)
13 - maven xap version - the xap version of the tested build (e.g 9.7.0-SNAPSHOT)
14 - maven cloudify version - the cloudify version of the tested build (2.7.0-5984-88-SNAPSHOT)
15 - maven repository path in the machines (e.g /tmp/LocalMavenRepos)
16 - flag which indicates if logstash will be enabled in tests or not (true or false)
17 - compute template which the service will run on - if dummy then SMALL_LINUX will be chosen, otherwise the input will be chosen

HOW TO UPDATE TESTER BUILD:
The Tester build is located in the client machine (192.168.9.18) under /export/tgrid/itests-deployer/cloudify-home.
In order to update this build you should:
1. Get the build and extract it under the same location with the same folder name (cloudify-home).
	1.1 This build should BigData and should be in s3 (publish builds)
2. In the updated build the ec2 cloud folder should be updated - in order to support large machines with custom configurations in the cloud driver as well as pem file in the upload folder.
	2.2 An example of ec2 folder is located in /export/tgrid/itests-deployer/ec2 and could be copied into the new tester build.
3. Update scripts in /export/tgrid/itests-deployer/Cloudify-iTests-Deployer/src/main/resources/services/iTests-Management (mysql,tomcat) and in 
   /export/tgrid/itests-deployer/Cloudify-iTests-Deployer/src/main/resources/services/cloudify-itests-service (install,start,stop) to make them run and compile in the tester build.
4. Update credentials folder (/export/tgrid/itests-deployer/credentials) if any chances were made to it in SVN.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
The TESTER version now is 9.6.0 GA - therefore groovy scripts are suitable to CloudifyRecipes branch 2.6.0 (mysql,tomcat and all groovy scripts in itests-service).
In order to change the TESTER version to newer version you should update all groovy scripts so compilation errors won't occur.

GIT PROJECT:
URL: https://github.com/CloudifySource/Cloudify-iTests-Deployer
All changes which were made in the client machine (192.168.9.18) should be eventually committed in the Cloudify-iTests-Deployer project.
